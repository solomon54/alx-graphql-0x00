# 🧪 Rick and Morty GraphQL Character Fixtures

This repository contains example GraphQL queries and their corresponding JSON output responses (fixtures) for fetching character data from The Rick and Morty API.

These files serve two main purposes:
1.**Documentation:** To clearly illustrate the input query and the exact expected output.
2. **Testing:** To be used as assertion data in automated tests for the GraphQL endpoint.

## 🚀 API Endpoint

All queries are executed against the following GraphQL endpoint:
`https://rickandmortyapi.com/graphql`

## 📂 File Structure

The project is organized into pairs of files for specific character IDs:

| Character ID | Query File (Input) | Output File (Expected Result) | Description |
| :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | `character-id-1.graphql` | `character-id-1-output.json` | Rick Sanchez |
| **2** | `character-id-2.graphql` | `character-id-2-output.json` | Morty Smith |
| **3** | `character-id-3.graphql` | `character-id-3-output.json` | Summer Smith |
| **4** | `character-id-4.graphql` | `character-id-4-output.json` | Beth Smith |

## 🔎 Data Fields Queried

Each query fetches the following subset of fields for the requested character:

* `id`: The character's unique ID.
* `name`: The character's full name.
* `status`: The character's living status (Alive, Dead, or unknown).
* `species`: The character's species (e.g., Human, Alien).
* `type`: A specific sub-type (often empty).
* `gender`: The character's gender.

## 📝 Example: Character ID 1

### 1. GraphQL Query (`character-id-1.graphql`)

```graphql
query CharacterID1 {
  character(id: 1) {
    id
    name
    status
    species
    type
    gender
  }
}
````

### 2\. Expected JSON Output (`character-id-1-output.json`)

```json
{
  "data": {
    "character": {
      "id": "1",
      "name": "Rick Sanchez",
      "status": "Alive",
      "species": "Human",
      "type": "",
      "gender": "Male"
    }
  }
}
```

## 🛠️ How to Replicate

The files were generated by following these steps:

1. A standalone query file (`.graphql`) was created for each character, targeting the `character(id: ID!)` field.
2. The query was executed against the public Rick and Morty GraphQL endpoint.
3. The complete JSON response was saved to the corresponding output file (`.json`).
